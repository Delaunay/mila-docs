# Contributing to the Mila Docs

Thank you for your interest into making a better documentation for all at Mila. Here are some gidelines to help bring your suggestions to life.

## What could be included

* Mila cluster usage
* Compute Canada cluster usage
* Job management tips / tricks
* Research good practices
* Software development good practices
* Useful tools

## Issues / PR

Issues can be used to notify about missing sections, broken tools or other suggestions to improve the overall documentation.

Pull requests are welcome! You can attempt to build the docs yourself to see if the formating is right:

```console
python3 -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
sphinx-build -b html docs/. docs/_build/
```

This will produce the html version of the documentation which you can navigate by opening `docs/_build/index.html`.

If you have any issues, don't hesitate to open an issue to request help or simply provide the content you would like to add in markdown if that is simpler for you.

## Sphinx / reStructuredText (reST)

The markup language used for the Mila Docs is [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) and we follow the [Pythonâ€™s Style Guide for documenting](https://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html#style-guide).

Here are some of reST syntax useful to know (more can be found in [Sphinx's reST Primer](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html)):

### Inline markup

* one asterisk: `*text*` for emphasis (italics),
* two asterisks: `**text**` for strong emphasis (boldface), and
* backquotes: ` ``text`` ` for code samples, and
* external links: `` `Link text <http://target>`_ ``.

### Lists

```reST
* this is
* a list

  * with a nested list
  * and some subitems

* and here the parent list continues
```

### Sections

```reST
=================
This is a heading
=================
```

There are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is determined from the succession of headings. However, the Python documentation is suggesting the following convention:

    * `#` with overline, for parts
    * `*` with overline, for chapters
    * `=`, for sections
    * `-`, for subsections
    * `^`, for subsubsections
    * `"`, for paragraphs

### Note box

```reST
.. note::
   This is a long
   long long note
```
