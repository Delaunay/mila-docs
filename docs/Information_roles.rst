Roles and authorisations
========================

There are mainly two types of researchers statuses at Mila :

#. Core researchers
#. Affiliated researchers

This is determined by Mila policy. Core researchers have access to the Mila
computing cluster. See your supervisor's Mila status to know what is your own
status.
