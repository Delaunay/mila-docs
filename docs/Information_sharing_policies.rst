Data sharing policies
=====================

.. _no_acl_note:

.. note:: To benefit from sharing functionalities on ``/network/scratch``,
   please contact the IT support who will configure the UNIX groups according
   to your needs.


`/network/projects <Information.html#storage>`_ aims to offer a collaborative
space for long-term projects. Data that should be kept for a longer period then
90 days can be stored in that location but first a request to `Mila's helpdesk
<https://it-support.mila.quebec>`_ has to be made to create the project
directory.
