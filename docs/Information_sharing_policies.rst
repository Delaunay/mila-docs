Data sharing policies
=====================

.. _no_acl_note:

.. note:: `/miniscratch <Information.html#storage>`_ aims to support Access
   Control Lists (ACL) to allows collaborative work on rapidly changing data, e.g.
   work in process datasets, model checkpoints, etc...


   As of august 2021, licensing issues on our filesystem keeps us from
   activating ACL functionalities. To benefit from sharing functionalities,
   please contact the IT support who will configure the UNIX groups according to
   your needs.


`/network/projects <Information.html#storage>`_ aims to offer a collaborative
space for long-term projects. Data that should be kept for a longer period then
90 days can be stored in that location but first a request to `Mila's helpdesk
<https://it-support.mila.quebec>`_ has to be made to create the project
directory.
