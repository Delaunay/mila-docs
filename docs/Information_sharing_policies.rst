Data sharing policies
=====================

.. _acl_note:

.. note:: `/network/scratch <Information.html#storage>`_ aims to support
   `Access Control Lists (ACLs)
   <https://cl-cheat-sheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#setfacl>`_
   to allow collaborative work on rapidly changing data, e.g. work in process
   datasets, model checkpoints, etc...


`/network/projects <Information.html#storage>`_ aims to offer a collaborative
space for long-term projects. Data that should be kept for a longer period then
90 days can be stored in that location but first a request to `Mila's helpdesk
<https://it-support.mila.quebec>`_ has to be made to create the project
directory.
