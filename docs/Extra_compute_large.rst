Access to exceptionally large computation capacity
==================================================

IDT offers a service to evaluate factual needs and solutions for researchers
requiring exceptionally large computational capacity for which the usual suspect
solutions (Mila cluster, Compute Canada) cannot provide the required capacity.

Steps :

#. Discuss your needs on the Mila Slack channel `#large_computation_needs
   <https://join.slack.com/share/zt-uofij6z5-pV1LuGW3pLADbkhddpuJ2g>`_
#. You will be communicated a series of criteria to determine if your project
   needs are a good fit for a demand to an international compute cluster.
   e.g.: Oak Ridge National Labs Summit cluster.
#. If your project is selected, IDT will fund a consultant to help you draft an
   allocation request to a selected external cluster to the height of 10 days
   accompaniment. ** A limit of three projects has been identified for 2021.
